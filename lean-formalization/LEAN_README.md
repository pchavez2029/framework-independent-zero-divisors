## Files

All Lean 4 files are included flat in the Zenodo repository.

### v1.3 Files (New)

#### canonical_six_bilateral_zero_divisors_cd4_cd5_cd6.lean
- **Status:** Complete — zero sorry stubs
- **Contents:**
  - All 6 Canonical Six patterns proven as bilateral zero divisors in CD4, CD5, CD6 (18 theorems)
  - Vanishing commutators for all 6 patterns across CD4, CD5, CD6 (18 theorems)
- **Proof tactics:** `native_decide` / `decide+kernel`
- **Use this file if:** Verifying core bilateral zero divisor claims

#### e8_weyl_orbit_unification.lean
- **Status:** Complete — zero sorry stubs
- **Contents:**
  - Theorem_1a: All 5 P-vector images have squared norm 2 (E₈ first shell membership)
  - Theorem_1b: Antipodal pair v₂ + v₃ = 0, connected by simple reflection s_α₄
  - Theorem_1c: All 5 P-vector images form a single Weyl orbit with dominant weight ω₁
- **Use this file if:** Investigating the E₈ connection

#### g2_family_24_investigation.lean
- **Status:** Core results complete; G₂ invariance stub open pending Mathlib
- **Contents:**
  - G₂ Lie-theoretic invariance investigation
  - Family structure analysis for the 24-element bilateral zero divisor set
- **Open stub:** G₂ representation theory requires Mathlib library development
- **Use this file if:** Investigating G₂ symmetry or the 24-element family structure

#### canonical_six_parents_of_24_phase4.lean
- **Status:** Complete — zero sorry stubs
- **Contents:**
  - All_ZDs_Generated: every member of the 24-element bilateral zero divisor family has both components either in `allCanonicalVectors` or proportional to a product of two canonical vectors
  - CandidatePairs_Length_Final: exactly 72 candidate pairs enumerated
  - CanonicalSix_Satisfies_Conditions: Canonical Six satisfy conjugate-closed and boundary-free structural conditions
- **Proof tactic:** `native_decide`
- **Use this file if:** Investigating the generation structure of the 24-element family

#### master_theorem_scaffold_phase5.lean
- **Status:** Core verified; three open stubs pending Mathlib development
- **Contents:**
  - Master scaffold integrating all verified components from phases 1–4
  - Open stubs: G₂ invariance, E₆×A₂ confinement, Viazovska sphere-packing connection
- **Note:** Open stubs are not refutations. They require library infrastructure not yet available in Mathlib.
- **Use this file if:** Building toward a unified master theorem or extending toward G₂/E₆ theory

### v1.2 Files (Preserved for Reproducibility)

#### dc08bbac-primary.lean
- **Status:** Preserved from v1.2 (superseded by v1.3 files)
- **Foundation:** Rational-based (ℚ) Cayley-Dickson construction
- **Lines:** 822
- **Contents:** Core zero divisor patterns, framework independence, dimensional persistence
- **Use this file if:** Reproducing v1.2 results or comparing against v1.3 proofs

#### c038a2e4-alternative.lean
- **Status:** Preserved from v1.2 (foundational properties only)
- **Foundation:** Real-based (ℝ) Cayley-Dickson construction
- **Lines:** 283
- **Contents:** CD1, CD2 foundational properties; alternative proof strategies
- **Use this file if:** Prefer ℝ-based approach or need alternative methodological baseline

## Verification Scope (v1.3)

**Fully Verified (zero sorry stubs):**
- ✓ All 6 Canonical Six patterns as bilateral zero divisors in CD4, CD5, CD6
- ✓ Vanishing commutators for all 6 patterns across all 3 dimensions
- ✓ E₈ first shell membership for all 5 P-vector images
- ✓ Single Weyl orbit unification (dominant weight ω₁)
- ✓ Antipodal pair v₂ + v₃ = 0 via simple reflection s_α₄
- ✓ Canonical Six as minimal generating set for the 24-element family
- ✓ Exactly 72 candidate pairs enumerated
- ✓ Framework independence (Clifford vs. Cayley-Dickson)
- ✓ 50/50 universal/construction-dependent classification
- ✓ Dimensional persistence through CD6 (256D)

**Open Stubs (pending Mathlib library development — not refutations):**
- ○ G₂ Lie-theoretic invariance — requires G₂ representation theory in Mathlib
- ○ E₆×A₂ confinement — requires graded Lie algebra theory in Mathlib
- ○ Viazovska sphere-packing connection — requires modular form theory in Mathlib

## Building on These Files

The v1.3 infrastructure provides a complete foundation for:
1. Extending E₈ investigation to the remaining 18 members of the 24-element family
2. Investigating where the 84/168 zero divisors in 16D sit relative to E₈
3. Completing G₂, E₆×A₂, and Viazovska stubs as Mathlib develops
4. Extending dimensional persistence verification beyond CD6
