## Version

**v1.3** — February 26, 2026

## Formal Verification

The following Lean 4 files are included in this repository and verify the mathematical claims in the paper.

**v1.2 files (preserved for reproducibility):**
- **Primary verification file:** dc08bbac-primary.lean
- **Alternative approach:** c038a2e4-alternative.lean (foundational)

**v1.3 files (new):**
- **canonical_six_bilateral_zero_divisors_cd4_cd5_cd6.lean** — 18 bilateral zero divisor theorems and 18 vanishing commutator theorems across CD4, CD5, CD6
- **e8_weyl_orbit_unification.lean** — E₈ first shell membership and Weyl orbit unification (Theorems 1a, 1b, 1c)
- **g2_family_24_investigation.lean** — G₂ Lie-theoretic invariance investigation and family structure analysis
- **canonical_six_parents_of_24_phase4.lean** — All_ZDs_Generated theorem: Canonical Six as minimal generating set for the 24-element bilateral zero divisor family
- **master_theorem_scaffold_phase5.lean** — Master scaffold integrating all verified components; open stubs for G₂, E₆×A₂, and Viazovska connections pending Mathlib library development

**See:** LEAN_README.md for full technical details.

## Verification Status

Full formal verification of all core results achieved in v1.3, with zero sorry stubs in any verified theorem. Verified results include:

- All 6 Canonical Six patterns proven as bilateral zero divisors in CD4, CD5, CD6 (18 theorems)
- Vanishing commutators for all 6 patterns across CD4, CD5, CD6 (18 theorems)
- All framework independence claims (universal vs. CD-specific)
- Dimensional persistence through 256D
- E₈ first shell membership for all 5 P-vector images (Theorem_1a)
- Single Weyl orbit unification with dominant weight ω₁ (Theorem_1c)
- Antipodal pair v₂ + v₃ = 0 connected by simple reflection s_α₄ (Theorem_1b)
- Canonical Six as minimal generating set for the complete 24-element bilateral zero divisor family (All_ZDs_Generated)
- Exactly 72 candidate pairs enumerated (CandidatePairs_Length_Final)

Three theoretical claims remain as open stubs pending Mathlib library development (G₂ invariance, E₆×A₂ confinement, Viazovska connection). These are not refutations.

## Reproducibility

All Lean files can be compiled using:
- Lean 4 v4.24.0
- Mathlib f897ebcf72cd16f89ab4577d0c826cd14afaafc7
